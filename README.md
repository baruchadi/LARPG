# LARPG

A Hackathon Project / Proof of concept. 
Uses IBM's Watson Api & LibGDX.

Made in 36 hours, 
uses graphics I had from old projects and some royalty free graphics. 

# What is it?!?
Ever wanted to learn a new language while playing a game? Well now you can! 
This game slowly changes its language, using a base game language of English.
You select which language you would like to learn at the beginning of the game, 
and the longer you play the game and progress, the more that the language will change.

We found out that Nouns are the easiest to translate since they tend to remain static in each language;
therefore, all the nouns in this game are the only part that changes at this time, using IBM's Watson translation technology.

The game will choose a new Noun to translate as you progress through checkpoints, and from that point on the word will remain in the other language.

# TODO: //maybe, in the future, if at all?

Add an in game dictionary with all of the words that were translated thus far.

evolve it to an actual game.
